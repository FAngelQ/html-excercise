    <h1>Cities I've lived In</h1>
        <p>I grew up in Los Angeles after arriving there from El Salvador, the place where I was born. I lived in FAyetteville when I was in the Army and then got to live in DC for a bit. I lived in Monterey when I went to graduate school and I lived in Riverside after I completed basic training in the US Army.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Los Angeles</strong></li>
        <li><em>El Salvador</em></li> 
        <li><strong>Fayetteville</strong></li> 
        <li><em>Washington DC</em></li> 
        <li><strong>Monterey</strong></li>
        <li><em>Riverside</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cities I'd Like to Visit</h2>
    <p>I learned Thai language in the Army but never got a chance to visit Thailand. I think it would be so much fun to visit and to practice my Thai language skills. Buenos Aires is the most European city in Latin America. I'd love to see what that's like. And Saint Peterburg has such a deep history. I'd love to spend a couple weeks there and learn as much as I can about the Russian empires over the years.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class = "city">Bankok</span> Because I need to practice Thai language</li>
            <li><span class = "city">Buenos Aires</span> It's the most European City in Latin America</li>
            <li><span class = "city">Saint Petersburg</span> So much history here</li>

        </ol>
